# Infathomed Foundations

This repository is a living lab and documentation set for foundational cybersecurity, networking, and tooling skills.

It is designed to demonstrate:
- Real-world security workflows
- Tool usage and methodology
- Technical documentation habits
- Evidence-based learning

This is not a collection of random notes — it is a structured, repeatable training environment aligned with:
- SOC analyst practices
- CySA+ concepts
- Per Scholas cybersecurity labs
- University of Phoenix ACYB coursework

## What this repository contains

This repository is organized around practical security domains:


### nmap/ → Network discovery, enumeration, and fingerprinting
### notes/ → Learning logs and technical reflections
### ports-and-services/ → Protocol and service mapping
### networking/ → TCP/IP and network fundamentals

Each folder contains:
- Documentation
- Command references
- Real scan outputs (when appropriate)
- Repeatable workflows

---

## Why this matters

In real security operations, analysts must be able to:
- Discover assets
- Enumerate services
- Identify operating systems
- Validate configurations
- Document findings

This repository demonstrates those skills using:
- Nmap
- Structured workflows
- Professional output formats
- Clear written explanations

---

## Ethics and Scope

All scanning and testing documented here is performed only on:
- Systems I own, or
- Networks where I have explicit permission

No unauthorized or illegal testing is performed.
